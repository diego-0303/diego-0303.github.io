Caltech ME/CS/EE 133a: Mobile Robots

LARY is a fully autonomous mobile robot I built as part of Caltechâ€™s capstone robotics course, designed to integrate key concepts in localization, planning, navigation, and mapping using the Robot Operating System (ROS). Working in a team of two, I assembled the robot from scratch, outfitted it with encoders, a gyroscope, and a lidar sensor, and implemented the full software stack required to operate it autonomously in real-world conditions.

Throughout the course, I programmed LARY to perform odometry, fuse sensor data for robust heading estimation, and localize on a known map while rejecting noise and outliers. I developed planning and control algorithms for collision-free navigation and incorporated online mapping to detect and avoid unknown obstacles. All algorithms were built and tested within the ROS framework, with extensive debugging and validation in hardware.

As a final challenge, LARY competed in a class-wide Pac-Man-inspired competition. The robot had to autonomously navigate a maze, collect tokens, and interact with dynamic agents simulating ghosts. LARY successfully completed all course requirements and placed 4th in the competition, demonstrating strong performance in autonomous decision-making, real-time navigation, and reactive behavior in a dynamic environment.

This project solidified my skills in ROS, sensor fusion, autonomous navigation, and hardware-software integration under real-world constraints.
