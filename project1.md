# Robotic Arm Project

![Robotic Arm](../LARY1.jpeg)

## Overview
Designed and built a 6-DOF robotic arm for my senior engineering capstone project. This project demonstrates advanced mechanical design, custom electronics integration, and sophisticated control software development.

## Project Details
The robotic arm features six degrees of freedom, allowing for complex movements and precise positioning. The system includes custom-designed mechanical components, integrated sensors for position feedback, and a Python-based control interface.

## My Role
- **Mechanical Design**: Created detailed CAD models and engineering drawings
- **Electronics Integration**: Designed custom PCB for motor control and sensor integration
- **Software Development**: Built Python control software with real-time position tracking
- **System Integration**: Coordinated all subsystems for seamless operation

## Technologies Used
- **Mechanical**: SolidWorks, 3D Printing, CNC Machining
- **Electronics**: Arduino, Custom PCB Design, Motor Drivers
- **Software**: Python, ROS (Robot Operating System), PID Control
- **Tools**: Git, Jupyter Notebooks, Oscilloscope

## Key Features
- 6-DOF movement capability
- Real-time position feedback
- Custom control interface
- Modular design for easy maintenance
- Safety interlocks and emergency stop functionality

## Results
Successfully completed the capstone project with a fully functional robotic arm that can perform complex pick-and-place operations with sub-millimeter precision.
