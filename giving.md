Growing up in an area that did not have many resources to explore my interests, I’ve always found it important to try my best to help out those in a similar situation.  That’s why this section of my website is dedicated to showcasing great opportunities and ways to get started following your interests regardless of socioeconomic status, location, or exposure>  Whether STEM related or not, I hope this is helpful.
