Hi, I'm Diego. I figured I'd make a webpage to feature some of my professional work alongside my interests. Here, you’ll find many of my projects from school, hobbies, and random thoughts I’ve felt compelled enough to write about. The idea is to form a conglomerate of sorts, of all my interests and the little intersections they form with each other. I need this webpage so I can keep track of them and actually make sure they’re fully explored.

I’ve always loved the idea of writing down goals and projects on a piece of paper to help actually complete the task. However, what happens if you lose your notebook?? That’s exactly what this webpage is for.

I’m currently working as a product engineer for a company that develops high-spec valves for space and naval applications. I also just graduated with my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Caltech. That being said, I have a lot of other interests I’d like to explore and that I find enjoyment in, like going on walks, taking photos, making videos, cooking, etc. Hopefully I can find a creative and seamless way to integrate those interests into this site.

With that said, I wish the warmest welcome to my site!
